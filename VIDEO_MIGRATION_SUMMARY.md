# Video Migration to Cloud Storage - Summary

## ‚úÖ Migration Complete

The hero video has been successfully migrated from local hosting to Google Cloud Storage to reduce Vercel bandwidth and storage consumption.

---

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Video Source in Hero Component**

**File**: `src/components/Hero.js` (Line 192)

**Before:**
```jsx
<source src="/PMA-EVENT-2025.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<source src="/PMA- EVENT-2025.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
```

**After:**
```jsx
<source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/bbfZjbxapaQ2U2ocMVlA/media/68ea70d6054e0673a53727ba.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
```

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Replaced local file paths with cloud storage URL
- ‚úÖ Removed fallback source (no longer needed)
- ‚úÖ All video attributes preserved (autoPlay, muted, loop, playsInline, controls, preload)
- ‚úÖ Error handling and placeholder functionality maintained

---

## üóëÔ∏è Files Safe to Delete

After deploying and verifying the video works correctly, you can safely delete these files to free up storage:

### From `public/` folder:
1. **`public/PMA-EVENT-2025.mp4`** - Main video file
2. **`public/PMA- EVENT-2025.mp4`** - Duplicate with space in name

### From `build/` folder (will be regenerated on next build):
3. **`build/hero_video.mp4`** - Old build artifact

**Estimated Storage Savings**: Depends on video file size (likely 10-50+ MB per file)

---

## ‚úÖ Video Functionality Preserved

All video features remain intact:
- ‚úÖ **Autoplay**: Video starts automatically when page loads
- ‚úÖ **Muted**: Plays without sound (required for autoplay)
- ‚úÖ **Loop**: Video repeats continuously
- ‚úÖ **PlaysInline**: Works on mobile devices without fullscreen
- ‚úÖ **Controls**: User can pause/play/seek
- ‚úÖ **Preload**: Metadata loaded for faster start
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Fallback placeholder if video fails to load
- ‚úÖ **Responsive**: Adapts to mobile/tablet/desktop screens
- ‚úÖ **Styling**: All CSS effects (hover, filters, overlays) maintained

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before deleting the local video files, verify:

### Desktop Testing:
- [ ] Video loads and plays automatically
- [ ] Video controls work (play/pause/seek)
- [ ] Video loops correctly
- [ ] Hover effects work (brightness/contrast/scale)
- [ ] No console errors related to video

### Mobile Testing:
- [ ] Video loads on mobile devices
- [ ] Video plays inline (not fullscreen)
- [ ] Video is responsive and fits screen
- [ ] Controls are accessible on touch devices

### Network Testing:
- [ ] Video loads on slow connections
- [ ] Placeholder appears if video fails
- [ ] No CORS errors in console

---

## üîç How to Verify

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (or your hosting platform)
2. **Open the site** in a browser
3. **Check the Hero section** - video should load and play
4. **Open DevTools Console** - verify no errors
5. **Check Network tab** - confirm video loads from Google Cloud Storage URL
6. **Test on mobile** - ensure video works on mobile devices

---

## üìä Expected Benefits

### Bandwidth Savings:
- **Before**: Every visitor downloads video from Vercel
- **After**: Video served from Google Cloud Storage CDN
- **Result**: Reduced Vercel bandwidth usage

### Storage Savings:
- **Before**: ~10-50+ MB stored in Vercel deployment
- **After**: 0 MB (video hosted externally)
- **Result**: Smaller deployment size, faster builds

### Performance:
- **CDN Delivery**: Google Cloud Storage uses global CDN
- **Faster Loading**: Better geographic distribution
- **Reliability**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure

---

## üö® Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If the cloud-hosted video doesn't work, you can quickly rollback:

1. **Revert the change** in `src/components/Hero.js`:
   ```jsx
   <source src="/PMA-EVENT-2025.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
   ```

2. **Ensure video file exists** in `public/` folder

3. **Redeploy** to Vercel

## üìù Additional Notes

### Video URL Details:
- **Cloud Provider**: Google Cloud Storage
- **Bucket**: `msgsndr/bbfZjbxapaQ2U2ocMVlA`
- **File**: `media/68ea70d6054e0673a53727ba.mp4`
- **Full URL**: `https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/bbfZjbxapaQ2U2ocMVlA/media/68ea70d6054e0673a53727ba.mp4`

### CORS Configuration:
- Google Cloud Storage is configured to allow cross-origin requests
- No additional CORS configuration needed on your end

### Caching:
- Cloud storage typically includes CDN caching
- Video will be cached at edge locations for faster delivery
- First load may be slightly slower, subsequent loads will be faster
