# Fix: Removed Direct Xendit Redirects

## Problem
Users were being redirected **directly to Xendit URLs** instead of staying on the app's checkout routes (`/checkout-student` or `/checkout-professional`).

## Root Cause
The `LeadModal.js` component had **fallback handlers** that redirected directly to Xendit URLs when:
1. The API call to `/api/lead` failed (line 89-106)
2. A network error occurred (line 127-145)

These fallbacks were meant to ensure users could still pay even if the API failed, but they bypassed our checkout routes entirely.

## What Was Happening

### Before Fix:
```
User submits form
  ↓
API call fails or network error
  ↓
Fallback: window.location.href = 'https://checkout.xendit.co/od/ai-student'
  ↓
User lands directly on Xendit (404 error because URL was wrong)
```

### After Fix:
```
User submits form
  ↓
API call fails or network error
  ↓
Fallback: window.location.href = '/checkout-student?email=...'
  ↓
User lands on our checkout route with embedded Xendit iframe
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/LeadModal.js`

#### Change 1: API Error Fallback (Lines 89-108)
**Before:**
```javascript
if (!res.ok) {
  console.error('API Error:', data);
  
  // Fallback: Direct redirect to Xendit if API fails
  console.log('API failed, using direct Xendit redirect');
  const studentUrl = 'https://checkout.xendit.co/od/ai-student';
  const proUrl = 'https://checkout.xendit.co/od/ai-professional';
  const chosen = role === 'student' ? studentUrl : proUrl;
  
  if (chosen) {
    window.location.href = chosen;  // ❌ Direct Xendit redirect
    return;
  }
  
  const errorMsg = data?.details || data?.error || `Server error (${res.status})`;
  setError(`Error: ${errorMsg}`);
  return;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (!res.ok) {
  console.error('API Error:', data);
  
  // Fallback: Redirect to checkout route even if API fails
  // This allows user to still complete payment, we'll update GHL manually later
  console.log('API failed, redirecting to checkout route anyway');
  
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    name: name.trim(),
    email: email.trim(),
    org: organization.trim(),
    year: yearInCollege.trim()
  });
  
  const checkoutRoute = role === 'student' ? '/checkout-student' : '/checkout-professional';
  
  close();
  window.location.href = `${checkoutRoute}?${params.toString()}`;  // ✅ Our checkout route
  return;
}
```

#### Change 2: Network Error Fallback (Lines 129-151)
**Before:**
```javascript
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Submit error:', e);
  
  // Fallback: Direct redirect to Xendit if network fails
  console.log('Network error, using direct Xendit redirect');
  const studentUrl = 'https://checkout.xendit.co/od/ai-student';
  const proUrl = 'https://checkout.xendit.co/od/ai-professional';
  const chosen = role === 'student' ? studentUrl : proUrl;
  
  if (chosen) {
    window.location.href = chosen;  // ❌ Direct Xendit redirect
    return;
  }
  
  setError(`Network error: ${e.message}`);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Submit error:', e);
  
  // Fallback: Redirect to checkout route even if network fails
  // This allows user to still complete payment, we'll update GHL manually later
  console.log('Network error, redirecting to checkout route anyway');
  
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    name: name.trim(),
    email: email.trim(),
    org: organization.trim(),
    year: yearInCollege.trim()
  });
  
  const checkoutRoute = role === 'student' ? '/checkout-student' : '/checkout-professional';
  
  close();
  window.location.href = `${checkoutRoute}?${params.toString()}`;  // ✅ Our checkout route
  return;
}
```

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Consistent User Experience**: Users always stay within the app, never redirected to external Xendit URLs
2. **Better Error Handling**: Even if API fails, users can still complete payment via the embedded iframe
3. **Email Preserved**: Email and other data stay in the URL for tracking
4. **Manual GHL Update**: If API fails to create contact initially, we can still update GHL when user clicks "I've Completed Payment"
5. **No More 404s**: Users never land on broken Xendit URLs

## Flow Now

### Success Case (API Works):
```
1. User submits lead form
2. POST /api/lead → Creates GHL contact
3. Response: { created: true, contactId: "..." }
4. LeadModal redirects to /checkout-student?email=...
5. CheckoutStudent component loads
6. Xendit iframe embedded
7. User completes payment
8. User clicks "I've Completed Payment"
9. POST /api/payment-success → Updates GHL with paid tag
10. Redirect to /eticket
```

### Fallback Case (API Fails):
```
1. User submits lead form
2. POST /api/lead → Fails (network error, server error, etc.)
3. LeadModal catches error
4. LeadModal redirects to /checkout-student?email=... anyway
5. CheckoutStudent component loads
6. Xendit iframe embedded
7. User completes payment
8. User clicks "I've Completed Payment"
9. POST /api/payment-success → Creates/updates GHL contact with paid tag
10. Redirect to /eticket
```

**Note**: In the fallback case, the contact might not be created initially, but it will be created/updated when the user clicks "I've Completed Payment" because `/api/payment-success` uses GHL's upsert API.

## Testing

### Test 1: Normal Flow (API Works)
1. Fill lead form as student
2. Submit
3. Should redirect to `/checkout-student?email=...`
4. Should see embedded Xendit iframe
5. Should NOT be redirected to external Xendit URL

### Test 2: API Failure (Simulate)
1. Disconnect internet or block API in DevTools
2. Fill lead form as student
3. Submit
4. Should still redirect to `/checkout-student?email=...`
5. Should see embedded Xendit iframe
6. Should NOT see error message or external redirect

### Test 3: Network Error (Simulate)
1. Use DevTools to simulate offline mode
2. Fill lead form as student
3. Submit
4. Should still redirect to `/checkout-student?email=...`
5. Should see embedded Xendit iframe

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check browser console**: Should see logs like:
   - "Contact created successfully: ..." (if API works)
   - "API failed, redirecting to checkout route anyway" (if API fails)
   - "Network error, redirecting to checkout route anyway" (if network fails)

2. **Check URL**: After form submission, URL should be:
   - `/checkout-student?email=...&org=...&year=...&name=...` (for students)
   - `/checkout-professional?email=...&org=...&name=...` (for professionals)

3. **Check page content**: Should see:
   - "Complete Your Payment - Student" or "Complete Your Payment - Professional"
   - Embedded Xendit iframe
   - "I've Completed Payment" button

4. **Check iframe src**: Should be:
   - `https://checkout-staging.xendit.co/od/aistudent` (localhost/staging)
   - `https://checkout.xendit.co/od/aistudent` (production)

## Summary

✅ **Removed all direct Xendit redirects**  
✅ **Users always stay on app's checkout routes**  
✅ **Fallback handlers redirect to checkout routes**  
✅ **Email and data preserved in URL**  
✅ **Consistent user experience**  
✅ **Better error handling**  

The app now properly keeps users within the app's routes and embeds Xendit in an iframe, regardless of whether the API succeeds or fails.
