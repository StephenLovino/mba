# Xendit API Integration - Upgrade Summary

## What Changed?

You now have **Xendit Production API keys**, which enable a much better payment integration than the static invoice links you were using before.

---

## ‚úÖ What I've Done

### 1. **Added API Keys to Environment**
Updated `.env.local` with your Xendit production keys:
- `XENDIT_SECRET_KEY` - For creating invoices (backend only)
- `XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY` - For future frontend integrations
- `XENDIT_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` - For webhook verification (you need to set this)

### 2. **Created New API Endpoint**
**File**: `api/create-invoice.js`

This endpoint creates a unique Xendit invoice for each user with:
- Pre-filled customer email and name
- Correct amount based on role (‚Ç±500 for students, ‚Ç±1000 for professionals)
- Metadata for tracking (email, role, organization, year)
- Automatic redirect URLs (success ‚Üí e-ticket, failure ‚Üí checkout)
- 24-hour expiration

### 3. **Updated Webhook Handler**
**File**: `api/webhooks/xendit.js`

Enhanced to:
- Extract role from invoice metadata (more reliable)
- Handle invoice payment events
- Update GHL contacts with payment tags automatically
- Better error handling and logging

### 4. **Updated Checkout Pages**
**Files**: 
- `src/components/CheckoutStudent.js`
- `src/components/CheckoutProfessional.js`

Changes:
- Now calls `/api/create-invoice` on page load
- Displays unique invoice URL in iframe
- Each user gets their own payment link with pre-filled data
- Automatic redirect after payment (no manual button needed)

### 5. **Created Documentation**
**Files**:
- `XENDIT_API_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration guide
- `XENDIT_API_UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## üöÄ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Webhook Verification Token

1. **Log in to Xendit Dashboard**: https://dashboard.xendit.co/
2. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks**
3. **Create a new webhook**:
   - **URL**: `https://your-production-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/xendit`
   - **Events**: Select `invoice.paid` and `invoice.expired`
   - **Verification Token**: Xendit will generate a token for you

4. **Copy the verification token** and add it to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   XENDIT_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Upgrade to Xendit API integration"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push
```

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables:
   ```
   XENDIT_SECRET_KEY=xnd_production_roNnnsml8yxPIJKyHmNtQ75i5QZmxSomwvbk1VEsQk3CfDhxQ5yA48LumquYDU
   XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY=xnd_public_production_jQMkqwNfMQyZmtMUNMmWORzCAFr_JmDQrTitOqTLtYKclCIUsFp6rFPbvEp0vIK
   XENDIT_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=your-webhook-token-from-step-1
   ```
4. **Redeploy** to apply the new environment variables

### Step 4: Test the Integration

1. **Fill out the registration form** as a student
2. **Check that**:
   - You're redirected to `/checkout-student`
   - A unique Xendit invoice loads in the iframe
   - Your email is pre-filled in the payment form
3. **Complete a test payment** (use Xendit test mode first)
4. **Verify**:
   - Webhook is received (check Vercel logs)
   - GHL contact is updated with `students-paid` tag
   - You're automatically redirected to `/eticket`
   - Confirmation email is sent

### Step 5: Test Professional Flow

Repeat the same test for professional registration (‚Ç±1000).

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Invoice Not Created

**Symptom**: Checkout page shows "Loading payment form..." forever

**Solutions**:

2. Verify `XENDIT_SECRET_KEY` is set in Vercel
3. Check Vercel function logs for `/api/create-invoice`

### Webhook Not Received

**Symptom**: Payment completes but GHL not updated

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook URL in Xendit dashboard is correct
2. Check `XENDIT_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` matches
3. Look for webhook delivery failures in Xendit dashboard
4. Check Vercel function logs for `/api/webhooks/xendit`

### Wrong Payment Tag

**Symptom**: Student gets `professionals-paid` tag or vice versa

**Solutions**:
1. Check invoice metadata in Xendit dashboard
2. Verify role is passed correctly to `/api/create-invoice`
3. Review webhook logs to see what role was detected

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If you need to revert to static links:

1. **In `CheckoutStudent.js` and `CheckoutProfessional.js`**:
   - Remove `createInvoice()` call
   - Remove `invoiceUrl` state
   - Change iframe `src` from `{invoiceUrl}` to `{getPaymentLink()}`

2. **Keep the manual confirmation button**:
   - Users will need to click "I've completed payment"
   - This calls `/api/payment-success` to update GHL

3. **Webhook will still work** for static links (if configured)

---

## üí° Future Enhancements

With API integration, you can now:

1. **Send invoice via email** instead of showing iframe
2. **Create recurring payments** for subscriptions
3. **Offer multiple payment methods** (cards, e-wallets, bank transfers)
4. **Generate payment reports** from Xendit dashboard
5. **Implement refunds** programmatically
6. **Add discount codes** or promotional pricing
